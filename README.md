# üß† ML Algorithms from Scratch

This repository contains implementations of classic algorithms and machine learning models built from scratch in Python using only `numpy` and basic libraries. Each notebook includes code, comments, and test cases to illustrate how the algorithms work.

## üìÇ Contents

| Notebook | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `a_star_search.ipynb` | Implementation of the A* Search algorithm with a sample 8-puzzle problem. Demonstrates pathfinding and heuristic-based search. |
| `naive_bayes_spam_filter.ipynb` | A Naive Bayes classifier for spam detection using a a subset of the TREC06 Public Spam Corpus, exploring the utilization of the top 200 informative words in an effort to improve spam detection. |
| `neural_network_classifier.ipynb` | Two-layer neural network trained on a multi-class (8-class) problem. Includes forward/backpropagation, utilization of SMOTE to balance the dataset, and visualization. |
| `adaboost_ensemble.ipynb` | An ensemble classifier using AdaBoost with weak learners (perceptron trained with the Pocket algorithm). Shows performance improvements over individual models, and potential to approximate an SVM classifier model. |

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Libraries
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebooks

## üéØ Goals
- Strengthen understanding of machine learning concepts by building models from scratch
- Practice writing clean, well-documented code
- Lay the foundation for more advanced ML/AI work in the future

## üìå Note
These are educational projects and not optimized for production. Built as part of my learning journey as an aspiring AI/ML Engineer/Data Scientist.
